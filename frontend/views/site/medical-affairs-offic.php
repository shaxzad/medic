                     Nursing is a highly complex, science-based field that requires specialist skills and training. Nurses work in an environment that is constantly changing. In order to provide the best possible care nurses must remain up to date with the latest models of care and advances in medical technology. In general, there are three educational paths to becoming a nurse:

                         Nursing Grand Rounds (NGR) provide an educational opportunity for our nurses to promote excellence in nursing through scholarly presentations. NGR provides HMC staff nurses with a forum to share clinical expertise and nursing best practice across HMC. Nurses gain new knowledge and learn new skills or improve current ones, in an environment of learning which focuses on both the science and the art of nursing.

                              Each month, Eiri Jones (HMC’s interim CNO) will host sessions for small groups of nurses and midwives from across HMC. The informal conversations are an important way for the CNO to acknowledge the contributions of nurses and midwives. These sessions also provide an opportunity for her to hear about the successes and challenges faced by frontline nurses. Nurses will be able to ask questions and make suggestions in a comfortable, informal setting.

                              These sessions are for Staff Nurses/Staff Midwives only. Future sessions will be held with other members of the nursing and midwifery service. Registration is on a first-come-first-served basis. Ten to twelve nurses will be invited to each session. If you would like to attend a session,  <a href="#" class="btn">click here</a> .

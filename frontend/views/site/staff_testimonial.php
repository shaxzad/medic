Having been in the palliative care field for 14 years, HMC was my first overseas experience and I am glad I took this opportunity as this has not only strengthened my clinical skills but has also allowed me to grow personally. Working for the past three years in a thriving multicultural environment and being in an organization where the senior management supports every member of their staff to be leaders and innovators has been a great learning experience. I have also benefitted immensely from the continuing education opportunities that are provided to us. We get to interact with some of the best leaders in our industry and these lectures and trainings constantly challenge us to think outside the box.&nbsp;
